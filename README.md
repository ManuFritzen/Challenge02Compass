## About 📝

**Challenge description:** Following your study trail, we will implement a small API for the frontend to consume, 2 routes
should be available, these being /user and /user/post. We'll keep it simple in this challenge to
improve it later, so both routes will be GET type and should return the list of users and the posts of
each user respectively.
No database will be used yet, so all the data provided by the API should be in a JSON file and posts
will not be saved anywhere yet either.
The user list will contain the names of all the scholars as well as a default password for everyone.
The JSON file is available at the end of this document.
When logging in, the user should be forwarded to the homepage with their proper data, name,
photo and etc.
The buddy list can contain all the scholars in the user list.
