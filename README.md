## About 📝

**Challenge description:** To continue, the API of uol's internal social network must be made, for this you must
follow the development based on this challenge.
Following your study trail, we will implement a real API for the frontend to consume.
For the persistence layer (database), can be used SQLite or MongoDB, choose one
and go with it.
Following the study trail, must be used typeorm.
There must be user authentication, use JWT for this, the token must expire in 12
hours.
When logging in, the user should be forwarded to the homepage with their proper
data, name, photo and etc.
The static json that was passed in the previous challenge will no longer be used. You
must store everything in the database of your choice.
For delivery, you must adapt the frontend to consume the backend and its respective
routes.
